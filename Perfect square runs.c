//You are given N player's runs of ICC Men's T20 World Cup of 2022.
//Now you need to tell how many of their runs are a perfect square.
//
//Note - A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the
//product of an integer by itself.
//
//Input Format
//
//The first line will contain T, the number of test cases.
//The first line of each test case contains a single positive integer N
//(number of players).
//The second line will contain N positive integers A1,A2,A3,A4â€¦..
//An (run of the players).
//Constraints
//
//0 < T <= 100
//1 <= N <= 100
//0 <= A[i] <= 100
//Output Format
//
//Print a single integer, count of the perfect square runs.
//If there doesn't exist any perfect
//square runs print -1. Don't forget to print a new line after
//printing the value.
//
//%%Sample Input 0
