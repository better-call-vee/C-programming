//Problem Statement
//
//Harry and Larry are now bored playing with numbers.
//Now they want to play with plus and minus signs.
//This time they donâ€™t want to give signs one by one.
//Anyone can give any number of signs at a time but at most N signs.
//Can you tell the maximum of all signs that they gave sequentially?
//
//For example:
//
//If the input is 7 + + - + - - - , then the answer is 3 as 3 minus signs are given sequentially and it is the maximum.
//If the input is 7 + + + + + - - , then the answer is 5.
//Input Format
//
//First line will contain a positive integer N
//Second line will contain N signs (+ or -)
//Constraints
//
//0 < N <= 100
//Output Format
//
//Output a single integer, the maximum of all signs that came sequentially.
//Sample Input 0
//
//7
//++++---
//Sample Output 0
//
//4
